/*
Word Guesser

● Create two arrays:
  ○ one for the letters of the word (e.g. 'C', 'A', 'T')
  ○ Another for the current guessed letters (start with '_', '_', '_' and add the correct letters to it).

● Write a function called guessLetter that should:
  ○ Take one parameter, a letter.
  ○ Have a maximum number of guesses (e.g. 6).
  ○ Check if the letter is in the word array.
  ○ If the letter matches, add it in the correct position of the guessed array.
  ○ Show the user the current guessed letters.
  ○ Tell the user if they guessed a correct letter.
  ○ Tell the user how many guesses remain.
  ○ Tell the user if they won or lost the game.

Call your function to make guesses:
  guessLetter('G');
  guessLetter('I');
  guessLetter('O');
  guessLetter('A');
  guessLetter('T');

● Bonus:
  ○ Add a reward for correct guesses and subtract an amount for failed guesses.
  ○ Show the user the total reward (positive or negative).
