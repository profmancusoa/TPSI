    <h2 class="titoloL2">localhost</h2>
    <p id="par1">In computer networking, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Localhost">localhost</a> is a hostname
        that refers
        to the current computer used to access it. It is used to access the network services that are running on the
        host via the loopback network interface.
        Using the loopback interface bypasses any local <strong>network</strong> interface hardware.</p>


    <h2 class="titoloL2">Loopback</h2>
    <p id="par2">The local <strong>loopback</strong> mechanism may be used to run a network service on a host without
        requiring a
        physical network interface, or without making the service accessible from the networks the computer may be
        connected to. For example, a locally installed website may be accessed from a Web browser by the URL
        http://localhost to display its home page.
        The name localhost normally resolves to the <abbr>IPv4</abbr> <small>loopback</small> address 127.0.0.1, and to
        the <abbr>IPv6</abbr> loopback address ::1.
    </p>

    <h2 class="titoloL2">Name resolution</h2>
    <p id="par3"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4">IPv4</a> network standards reserve the entire address
        block
        127.0.0.0/8 (more than 16 million addresses) for loopback purposes.[2] That means any packet sent to any of
        those addresses is looped back. The address 127.0.0.1 is the standard address for IPv4 loopback traffic; the
        rest are not supported by all operating systems. However, they can be used to set up multiple server
        applications on the host, all listening on the same port number. The IPv6 standard assigns only a single address
        for loopback: ::1.
        The <strong>resolution</strong> of the name <small>localhost</small> to one or more <q>IP addresses is normally
            configured by the following lines in the operating system's hosts file:</q>
        127.0.0.1 localhost
        ::1 <em>localhost</em>
    </p>

    <p id="par4">The name may also be resolved by <cite>Domain Name System</cite> <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System">(DNS)</a> servers, but queries for this name should
        be resolved locally, and should not be forwarded to remote name servers. </p>

    <p>
    <blockquote>In addition to the mapping of <u>localhost</u> to the loopback addresses (127.0.0.1 and ::1)
    </blockquote>, localhost may also be mapped to other IPv4 (loopback) addresses and it is also possible to assign
    other, or additional, names to any loopback address. The mapping of localhost to addresses other than the designated
    loopback address range in the hosts file or in DNS is not guaranteed to have the desired effect, as applications may
    map the name internally. </p>

    <p id="par5">In the <mark>Domain</mark> Name System, the name <mark>localhost</mark> is reserved as a
        <u>top-level</u> domain
        name, originally set aside to avoid confusion with the hostname used for loopback purposes.[3] IETF standards
        prohibit domain name registrars from assigning the name localhost.
    </p>

    <h2 class="titoloL2">IETF standards </h2>
    <div style="background-color: blue; color: white;">
        <p>The name <small>localhost</small> is reserved for loopback <del>purposes</del> by <small>RFC</small> 6761
            (Special-Use Domain Names),[4] which achieved the Proposed Standard maturity level in February 2013. The
            standard sets forth a number of special considerations governing the use of the name in the Domain Name
            System: </p>
    </div>
    <p id="par6">An <abbr>IPv4</abbr> or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv6">IPv6</a> address query for the
        name
        <u>localhost</u> must always resolve to the respective loopback address, which is specified in a separate
        standard.
        <span style="color:red;">Applications</span> may resolve the name to <q>a loopback address themselves, or pass
            it to the local name resolver mechanisms.</q>
        When a name resolver receives an address <strong>(A or AAAA)</strong> <mark>query</mark> for <s>localhost</s>,
        it should return the <s>appropriate</s> loopback addresses, and negative responses for any other requested
        record types. <ins>Queries</ins> for localhost should not be sent to caching name servers.
        To avoid burdening the Domain <mark>Name</mark> System root servers with <s>traffic</s>, caching name servers
        should never request name <u>server</u> records for localhost, or forward resolution to authoritative name
        servers.
        <b>DNS</b> registrars are precluded from delegating domain names in the top-level domain <u>localhost</u>.
        When authoritative name servers receive <strong>queries</strong> for <span
            style="color: blue;">'localhost'</span> in spite of the provisions mentioned resolve them appropriately.
        The <em>IPv4</em> loopback addresses are <del>reserved</del> within the <b>IPv4</b> address space by the IETF
        "Special Use IPv4 Addresses" <s>standard</s> (RFC 5735).[5] The reservation can be traced back to the
        <ins>November 1986</ins> "Assigned Numbers" standard (RFC <sup>990</sup>).
    </p>
    <img src="img/ipAddress.png" alt="ipAddress">
    <div style="background-color: blue; color: white;">
        <p>In contrast, the <i>IETF</i> "IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture" <em>standard</em> (RFC 4291) reserves the
            single <u>IPv6</u> loopback address ::1 within the IPv6 address space. The standard precludes the assignment
            of that address to any physical interface, as well as its use as the source or destination address in any
            packet sent to remote hosts. Any such packet that is erroneously transmitted is not supposed to be routed,
            and should be dropped by all routers or hosts that receive it. </p>
    </div>
    <h2 class="titoloL2">Packet processing </h2>
    <p id="par7">The processing of any <span style="color: green;">packet</span> sent to a loopback address, is
        implemented in the
        link layer of the TCP/IP stack. Such packets are never passed to any <ins>network</ins> interface controller
        (NIC) or hardware device driver and must not appear outside of a computing system, or be routed by any
        <i>router</i>. This permits software testing and local services in the absence of any hardware network
        interfaces.
    </p>

    <p id="par8"><i>Looped-back</i> packets are <del>distinguished</del> from any other <b>packets</b> traversing the
        <u>TCP/IP</u> stack only by the special IP address they were addressed to. Thus, the services that ultimately
        receive them respond according to the specified destination. For example, an HTTP service could route packets
        addressed to 127.0.0.99:80 and 127.0.0.100:80 to different Web servers, or to a single server that returns
        different web pages. To simplify such testing, the hosts file may be configured to provide appropriate names for
        each address.
    </p>

    <p>Packets received on a <small>non-loopback</small> <span style="color: red;">interface</span> with a loopback
        source or <s>destination</s> address must be dropped. Such packets are sometimes <ins>referred</ins> to as
        Martian packets.<sub>[6]</sub> As with any other bogus packets, they may be malicious and any problems they
        might cause can be avoided by applying bogon filtering. </p>

    <h2 class="titoloL2">special cases</h2>

    <p>The releases of the <a href="https://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> <em>database</em> <q>differentiate between the use
            of the <u>hostname</u> localhost </q>and the use of the addresses 127.0.0.1 and ::1.[7] When using
        <ins>localhost</ins> as the destination in a client connector interface of an application, the MySQL application
        programming interface connects to the <i>database</i> using a Unix domain socket, while a TCP connection via the
        loopback interface requires the direct use of the explicit address.

    <p>One <mark>notable</mark> <em>exception</em> to the use of the <span style="color: blue;">127.0.0.0/8</span>
        <b>addresses</b> is their use in <b>Multiprotocol</b> Label Switching (MPLS) traceroute <del>error</del>
        detection, in which their <del>property</del> of not being routable provides a convenient means to avoid
        delivery of faulty packets to end <i>users</i>.
